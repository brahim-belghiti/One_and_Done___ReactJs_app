### What is?
Sometimes a friend or a coworker sends you a YouTube video to watch, while working. And you tell yourself, I'm going to watch it and comeback to work. But before you know it, you find yourself have spent more than 30 minutes on YouTube (The average mobile YouTube session is now 40 minutes).  
So this small minimalist web app is a solution to this problem. If you have to watch that video, then watch it here, and go about your work.  
this could be applied to watching a youtube tutorial to get some quick information and leave before being tempted to see the other videos.
